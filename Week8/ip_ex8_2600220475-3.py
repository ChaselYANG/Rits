Program description:The program take the list and flattens it ,and changes
it to add it to the normal list.
Then filter the positive numbers in the list and the two stored in 
the list,Odd and even numbers. It have 3 parameters which are the list of
 numbers, even and odd numbers.
Last step delete duplicate content from the list.
